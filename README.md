# Remote-controlled car with autonomous mode
### The car has a bluetooth sensor that receives requests sent via the [mobile application](https://github.com/miszu98/Mobile-App-arduino-car-remote-control) written in ```JAVA```. The car in autonomous mode, if it encounters an obstacle, looks for an optional solution to the situation (the sensor looks for a further distance to the obstacle and turns to that side)
